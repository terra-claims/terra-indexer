# terra-indexer

Key part of making Terra Claims decentralized is that everything can in theory be done on a mobile app performing lookups onto the blockchain.

The reality though is that searchability is an important aspect of any kind of geo service. The Terra Claims indexer is listens to events  on both the Property Registry and the Claims Registry.

This allows the mobile app and third parties to quickly lookup properties registered in the area and perhaps overlapping with other properties.
